This project is a **system that converts real human portraits into anime-style characters**.  
Using Python and TensorFlow, we implemented a CNN-based image style transfer model,  
especially employing a **U-Net architecture** to preserve edge details and color fidelity.  
The final product includes a simple web interface that allows users to upload an image  
and instantly view its cartoon-styled version.
