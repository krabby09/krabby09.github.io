This project analyzes **user interactionsâ€”clicks, views, and watch time**  
to provide **personalized content recommendations**.  
We implemented the **LightFM model**, combining collaborative and content-based filtering,  
and deployed it via a **Flask server** as a real-time recommendation API.  
As a result, recommendation accuracy improved by approximately **18%**.
